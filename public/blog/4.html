                <h1>Going Parallel with <code>node.js</code></h1>
                <p>
                    <code>node.js</code> needs no introduction at this point.  The single thread
                    V8-powered JavaScript server's speed is predicated on asynchronous disk reads
                    (operations such as database access), keeping the CPU from blocking on these
                    by using callbacks.
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/6249540.js"></script>
                <p>
                    In the first example, the CPU is blocked while the <code>synchronousRead</code>
                    operation is performed.  The code is not allowed to continue because <code>emit</code>
                    depends on the retrieved value as part of the flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second, node.js-spirited example, the call to <code>asynchronousRead</code>
                    executes quickly and the execution of the code finishes.  The CPU is not blocked.
                    Whenever <code>asynchronousRead</code> completes, the callback supplied to it will
                    be executed and the value will be emitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Performing actions asynchronously in <code>node.js</code> already improves
                    speed, but it's possible to eke even more speed out of the server by performing
                    multiple disk operations in parallel instead of serially.  There may be many
                    possible ways to do this, but a simple one is with <code>node.js</code>'s
                    <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async"><code>async</code></a> module.
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/6249591.js"></script>
                <p>
                    In the first example, the first operation must complete before the second one can
                    begin.  The CPU does not block while the first operation is running so other requests
                    can be serviced, but the response for an individual request is much slower than
                    in the second example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>async</code> will allow for two disk reads to occur simultaneously, allowing
                    for a faster response time.  The <code>callback</code> that is passed in to the
                    <code>parallel</code> functions is itself a function that your own defined functions
                    will call.  Then, the final callback (the second argument to <code>parallel</code>)
                    will execute when all the functions have completed with its results in order
                    of the function calls.
                </p>
