                <h1>Just install <code>zsh</code></h1>
                <p>
                    This post is coming directly from someone who initially had doubts about
                    <code><a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a></code> as a <code>bash</code>
                    user and eventually made the switch after a little coaxing from
                    new coworkers.  I have no experience using any other shell besides
                    <code>bash</code>, so I can't compare <code>zsh</code> to others
                    such as <code><a href="http://fishshell.com/">fish</code></a>.  Their
                    website is almost hilarious enough to make me change indiscriminately,
                    but let's just talk about <code>zsh</code> for now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Installation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've installed <code>zsh</code> on Ubuntu, Arch Linux, and OS/X
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>zsh</code> is the default shell on Arch and <em>appears</em>
                        to be bundled with the boot iso.  You can start using it before
                        it's even installed.  If you're using Arch, you have no fear of
                        <code>zsh</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For Ubuntu, all you need is <code>sudo apt-get install zsh</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For OS/X, <code><a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">brew</a> install zsh</code>
                        will do.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Similar steps should work for other distributions, and screw Windows, and the
                    <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">Windows <code>git-scm</code></a> comes
                    packaged with a version of cygwin that uses <code>zsh</code>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once <code>zsh</code> is installed you can set it as your login
                    shell with the command <code>chsh -s /bin/zsh</code>
                    (or wherever <code>zsh</code> happens to be installed).
                    Keep in mind that this is your <em>login</em> shell, so it won't
                    take effect unless you relog even if you do not have a terminal
                    instance running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also of course use <code>zsh</code> without relogging by
                    simply running it with ... <code>zsh</code> ... and be dropped
                    into the shell.  This should still source <code>.zshrc</code> et. al.
                    In fact if <code>zsh</code> is not installed under <code>/bin</code>
                    for some reason -- perhaps you don't have root access -- it is
                    advisable to run <code>zsh</code> from another shell such as
                    the default login (probably <code>bash</code>).
                </p>
                <h2>Why not <code>zsh</code>?</h2>
                <p>
                    I've seen several blog posts that start with a section of "Why <code>zsh</code>?"
                    You can go read these if you want, but a summary is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Total compatibility with <code>bash</code>.  You can use <code>zsh</code>
                        just like <code>bash</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Better built in tab completion and simpler tab completion API.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can probably do most of what you can do in <code>zsh</code> in
                    <code>bash</code>, but most of what you want to do is done for you.
                    As for why <em>not</em> <code>zsh</code>, I only have a couple of
                    complaints to be honest:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        History expansion expands on the current command on <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
                        I'd rather it run immediately.  Fortunately this is just a simple
                        settings change: <code>set +o HIST_VERIFY</code> (<code>+o</code>
                        disables the option).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tab completion is case sensitive.  I'd prefer if it were smartcase.
                        For example, when I type <kbd>Res&lt;Tab</kbd> I only want words
                        starting with "R" to be part of the completion words (or at least
                        cycle them first), but instead <code>zsh</code> will cycle through
                        "r" words if they come first alphabetically.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These are pretty minor complaints.  Another complaint I had initially
                    with <code>zsh</code> was that I couldn't randomize the <code>@</code>
                    color on my <code>PS1</code>.
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/6517720.js"></script>
                <p>
                    Most of this works in <code>zsh</code>, except for the command substitution
                    (<code>$()</code> part).  At least I couldn't get it to work the way I
                    wanted.  This, along with the slightly overwhelming tab completion made me
                    shy away from <code>zsh</code> without giving it much of a try.
                </p>
                <h3>Tab Completion Lesson #0</h3>
                <p>
                    <code>zsh</code>'s tab completion is not that complicated.  If there is more
                    than one possible word and you <kbd>Tab</kbd>, all available words will be
                    listed based on the current completion algorithm (generally links in the
                    current directory are listed).  <kbd>Tab</kbd> again and the first word will
                    be highlighted.  <kbd>Tab</kbd> to cycle through the words, <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>
                    to go back, and use the arrow keys to navigate horizontally (and vertically
                    too).  Unfortunately you need to use the arrow keys to navigate as opposed
                    to the traditional <kbd>hjkl</kbd> as this will simply start to type the next word,
                    selecting the previous word if one is highlighted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a word is highlighted from the list, <kbd>Enter</kbd> will select it.  <kbd>Space</kbd>
                    or any other character also works, but typing <kbd>Space</kbd> will end the previous
                    word and any other character ends the word with a space.  The difference is if you
                    select a directory and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, the word is not ended but is changed to
                    <code>directory-name/</code>, and <kbd>Tab</kbd> will list files in that directory now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't forget that <kbd>Ctrl+c</kbd> works pretty well if you get stuck.
                </p>
                <h3>Randomize color in prompt</h3>
                <p>
                    While this is very specific, the existence of <code>add-zsh-hook</code> and its options
                    including <code>precmd</code>.  I can't find any manual on this command as part
                    of the installation, but it is described on <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Hook-Functions">
                    the <code>zsh</code> web documentation</a>.  This is on Sourceforge, so I don't know how
                    current it is, but it's there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was able to randomize the <code>@</code> (with a little <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11528381/zsh-random-color-in-ps1"
                    >Stackoverflow</a> help).
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/6517907.js"></script>
                <p>
                    This of course belongs in the <code>.zshrc</code>, or selected
                    <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> theme.
                    By the way, I suggest oh-my-zsh as it comes with tab completion for
                    a lot of common executables.
