                <h1>Running a .NET Web App on a Virtual Machine on Linux Installed on a Macbook to Debug With an Android Emulator</h1>
                <p>
                    It's really difficult for me not to make an inception joke about this whole process, but I've never actually
                    seen that movie.  Many thanks to Andrew K. for his help setting this deal up.  Without him, I never would have
                    been able to debug this project.
                </p>
                <h2>Acquiring a Macbook and installing Linux</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a pretty obvious first step.  Let's assume that you already have a Macbook.  Actually that part is not
                    particularly important.  Any computer will do.  <a href="http://www.alexvictorchan.com/2013/05/01/installing-ubuntu-13-04-on-13-macbook-pro-retina-102/"
                    >This tutorial on installing Ubuntu on a Macbook</a> was really helpful.  I don't have a 13" retina, so presumably
                    this tutorial will work with others in the Macbook family as well.  I've also had a great experience with <code><a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/">rEFInd</a></code>,
                    which the article links to (or should I say "to which the article links").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ubuntu is certainly not a requirement here.  Any Linux distribution with a GUI should be able to run VirtualBox
                    and be able to support port forwarding.  I also tried installing Arch Linux to boot from <code>rEFInd</code>, but
                    I ran into a lot of trouble and somehow corrupted my Ubuntu partition in the process.  I'll try again at some
                    point, but the Macbook is my work computer and has to be available to me for development at any time.
                </p>
                <h2>Virtual Machine Software</h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people seem to love VMWare, but I personally prefer <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads">VirtualBox</a>.
                    You can use <code>dpkg</code> to install the <code>.deb</code> yourself if you desire, but VirtualBox is also available as
                    an aptitude package and you can install it from the command line too: <code>sudo apt-get install virtualbox</code>.  The command
                    <code>virtualbox</code> will start up the GUI, but the helpful <code>vboxmanage</code> command line tool is also available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>This guide will use VirtualBox</strong> as the Virtual Machine software.  If you want to use something else, you are
                    on your own.  The concepts should be the same, though.
                </p>
                <h2>Installing Windows</h2>
                <p>
                    You will need a Windows boot CD, USB, or ISO.  I can't give one to you, but hopefully you already have one.  Once you do, start
                    <code>virtualbox</code> and choose New.  Pick an appropriate name for the VM (I just used "Windows") and select the version
                    that will be installed.  If you have an ISO it's probably in the name.  It may also be written on the CD.  You can just ask
                    whoever provided it to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, unless you know what you're doing more than I do, just stick with the defaults.  Choose to create a new virtual
                    disk, and choose VDI as the hard drive type.  You can choose either "Dynamically allocated" or "Fixed size" though.  Supposedly
                    the latter is faster, but you will be able to grow and shrink the partition size of the former as needed.  Choose the appropriate
                    folder and ROM size.  I wouldn't go less than 25G for the partition size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the VM will appear in VirtualBox's list of VMs.  Installing from an ISO is the simplest, so hopefully you have one available.
                    Boot the new VM (double-click it or select "Start" from the toolbar) and you will be asked for the location of the boot disk.
                    Select the ISO and wait for several hours while Windows is installed.  Once that is complete you can theoretically discard the ISO
                    as it probably takes up a lot of space, but beware as you won't be able to install the OS afresh again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> that if you do remove the ISO file, VirtualBox will complain when you boot.  It will still boot from the OS
                    installed on the virtual hard disk.  If you want to stop it from complaining, while the VM is powered off select "Settings -> Storage,
                    and remove the ISO.  You can also simply choose to ignore the warning as it is harmless in this case.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <h1>Increasing an existing VM's size</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> that this is not a necessary step.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you already have a virtual machine partition, you may want to increase the ROM size.  You can't do this with a fixed partition,
                        but you can with a standard partition.  One solution is to clone the fixed partition and then increase that one's size.  If it's
                        Windows, you have to boot it and then use "Disk Manager," right click "C:" and select "Extend Volume."  Your guess is as good as
                        mine as to where "Disk Manager" actually is so I just opened up "My Computer" and use "Search" to find it.  Certainly it's in different
                        spots in different versions (Windows 7, Windows 8).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The actual commands you would use would be
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    $ cd ~/VirtualBox\ VMs # what's with the space?
    $ cd $DESIRED_VM_DIR
    $ vboxmanage clonehd --variant Standard $VBOX_NAME.vdi $NEW_NAME.vdi
    $ vboxmanage modifyhd $NEW_NAME.vdi --resize 51200 # 50G, it's in MB
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Note that only the <code>modifyhd</code> command is necessary if the disk is already Standard and not Fixed.
                        <code>vboxmanage</code> will complain if you try to resize a fixed partition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point you can use the VirtualBox GUI to create a new VM from the cloned <code>.vdi</code> file.
                        There is probably a way to do this via <code>vboxmanage</code> as well, but I didn't try.
                    </p>
