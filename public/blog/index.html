                        You don't have to spend much time on Stackoverflow
                        before you find someone saying something like
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        I have JSON like <code>{key: value}</code>.
                        How do I access value?

                    <p>
                        It won't take long before a pedant points out
                        that a JavaScript object (either an object literal
                        or an object derived from some other code) is
                        <em>not</em> JSON.  I am more than happy to be
                        one of those pedants as well.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Misnomer</h2>
                    <p>
                        While the vast majority of examples of JSON I've seen
                        use objects, this is not a requirement.  The below
                        examples are all valid JSON.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2</li>
                        <li>[]</li>
                        <li>true</li>
                        <li>false</li>
                        <li>null</li>
                        <li>"this is a string"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It should be obvious to anyone familiar with JSON that
                        none of these are objects.  However,
                        <code>JSON.parse('2')</code> will happily extract the
                        number "2."  Without getting into an argument about
                        whether or not 2 can be considered an object in
                        some circumstances, it is not an <em>object literal</em>
                        in JavaScript.  Even so, none of these constructs are
                        particularly useful on their own except possibly
                        arrays.
                    </p>
                    <p class=warn>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> it's probably worth noting that
                        "nothing" is not valid JSON.  Many JSON parsers will
                        complain when parsing an empty string, e.g.
                        <code>JSON.parse("")</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, I think that JSON is a good name.  It's easy
                        to pronounce, and it was at least <em>inspired</em>
                        by JavaScript Object literal syntax.  Regardless, referring
                        to a JavaScript object as JSON is not correct.
                        It's idiomatic to refer to a string containing valid
                        JSON as "JSON."  "JSON string" may be more accurate,
                        but I've tossed the phrase "parse xml" when I was talking
                        about a string in plenty of cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This doesn't mean that JSON <em>has</em> to be a string
                        either.  It's a notation -- an idea.  It's just convenient
                        to refer to a construct that you can successfully use
                        <code>JSON.parse</code> on as "JSON."
                    </p>
                    <h3>Who's to blame?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Usually in the context of JavaScript code when people
                        refer to JSON what they actually mean is a JavaScript
                        object (or just "Object" to avoid redundancy).
                        While it is true that JSON can be parsed into a
                        JavaScript object in some circumstances, this doesn't
                        mean that they are analogous.  Part of the confusion
                        does stem from documentation including the
                        <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627">RFC (4627)</a>
                        that actually names the thing JavaScript <strong>Object</strong>
                        Notation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another source of the problem is probably the
                        monster <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
                        When I say "monster" I am referring to its meteoric
                        rise to fame and its ability to influence the JavaScript
                        community and new developers.  I happen to love
                        the library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        jQuery will conveniently black box the parsing of
                        JSON in some circumstances.  For instance, if
                        valid JSON is received from a request via
                        <code>$.getJSON</code>, jQuery will parse it behind
                        the scenes and the response returned to the done
                        method will already be parsed.  As I've said this is
                        almost always a JavaScript object, so one could easily
                        think that this is just what JSON is and how it works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This can actually lead to confusion if one assumes
                        that jQuery will only return a request raw.
                        The below will explode horribly (it would if using
                        <code>JSON.parse</code> for the same reason).  JavaScript
                        will attempt to convert the already parsed data in
                        <code>json</code> to a string that is obviously not
                        valid JSON.

                    <p>
                        This could lead to a stackoverflow question from a confused
                        user.  They will quickly get comments about how everything
                        should work if they just remove the line containing
                        <code>$.parseJSON</code>.  However, their variable will
                        still be named <code>json</code> even though it's
                        not JSON.  Not by any standard -- nor was it ever.
                        Still, their code refers to it as <code>json</code>,
                        other perhaps even less experienced developers will
                        think of it as JSON, and the cycle continues.
                    </p>
                    <h2>When JavaScript is not JSON and vice versa</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of circumstances where JavaScript
                        is not valid JSON.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/6939254.js"></script>
                    <p>
                        There are also circumstances where JSON is not valid
                        JavaScript.  In fact, since JavaScript does not support
                        bare objects, the simple statement <code>{"k":"v"}</code>
                        will emit an error in JavaScript (go ahead and try it
                        in your browser console) whereas it can be parsed
                        as valid JSON.  However, the expression
                        <code>({"k":"v"})</code> is valid (albeit it useless).
                        The parentheses turn the code into an expression
                        that can be evaluated.  This is similar to why you need
                        <code>=</code> or parens to immediately invoke
                        a function from its declaration.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/6939346.js"></script>
                    <p>
                        Astute readers will note that parentheses are not
                        a valid part of JSON syntax.  Thus the statement
                        <code>{"k":"v"}</code> can be considered valid JSON
                        but an error in JavaScript.  <code>({"k":"v"})</code>
                        is <em>not</em> valid JSON because of the parentheses
                        -- the very construct that turns the statement into
                        an expression in JavaScript, allowing it to run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point many readers may be saying, "so what"
                        (and knowing developers, plenty are probably saying,
                        "so true.")  I don't have a great answer for that.
                        If you can correctly point out when JavaScript is
                        not JSON you might feel some sense of superiority over
                        others who may not recognize this fact so readily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In defense of the JavaScript vs. JSON recognition argument,
                        I think that clarity and consistency are
                        important -- especially in the software development world.
                        You shouldn't call something something when it isn't
                        something.  You should call it what it is.  It's also
                        important to know what makes valid JSON vs. JavaScript
                        because it's quite likely that if you have to work
                        with one you will have to work with the other.

                    <h2>JSONP is not JSON</h2>
                    <p>
                        Adding to the confusion is the existence of
                        <a href="http://json-p.org/">JSONP</a>.
                        Now that the awesome power of
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing"
                        >CORS</a> is available, JSONP may slowly die, but as long as
                        <code>XDomainRequest</code> is required by IE8 and IE9,
                        we'll be held back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JSONP is called "JSON with padding," so it only serves
                        to further the confusion.  In fact, JSONP is not
                        JSON and it doesn't even have anything to do <em>with</em>
                        JSON.  Incidentally valid JSON will work when JSONP
                        is used correctly, but this is not even a requirement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JSONP is actually JavaScript.  In fact, the recommended
                        content type for the response is <code>application/javascript</code>.
                        Ostensibly there is a proposal that <code>application/json-p</code>
                        be used for security reasons, but as far as I know this
                        content type is not actually implemented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A JSONP response needs to be valid JavaScript because
                        it is actually <em>run as JavaScript</em>.  As discussed
                        above, a valid JSON response and valid JavaScript
                        are generally incompatible.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/6939922.js"></script>
                    <p>
                        Even though the object that is the argument of the callback
                        above <code>could</code> have been written as valid
                        JSON (i.e. with notation that could be parsed via
                        <code>JSON.parse</code>) it's not.  It will still run
                        just fine after a JSONP request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This can lead to a tremendous amount of confusion --
                        perhaps even more than jQuery's automatic parsing.
                        Attempting a jsonp request and getting a JSON
                        response will lead to the potentially confusing error

                        and a lack of good standardization for JSONP can
                        make debugging hell.  This may seem like a contrived
                        circumstance, <em>but it actually happened to my
                        team yesterday</em>.  Fortunately, I immediately
                        recognized the problem and was able to clear it up.

                        Even though the confusion many have between JSON
                        and JavaScript Object (or JavaScript Object literal at
                        times) may not be that big of a deal, JSON vs.
                        JSONP is a huge deal.  It would make a lot more sense
                        if it were called script tag injection, which is what
                        it is, but the "injection" bogeyman would not make
                        this term very marketable.  It would also have the
                        same initialism as "sexually transmitted infection."
                        Actually, that may make the name more accurate than
                        anything having to do with JSON.
