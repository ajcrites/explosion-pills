                        >Git Flow</a>, or <em>A successful Git branching model</em>
                        is all the rage these days when it comes to application
                        development -- and with good reason.  This is an excellent,
                        if not the preeminent workflow available.  It applies
                        to any development methodology that I can think of, and
                        it's especially suited for Agile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When introducing new developers to the concept of
                        <code>git-flow</code>, it's often done as a whole.
                        We explain the important components like the feature
                        and release branches and try to ingrain knowledge of
                        basic git commands.  It's very easy to lose sight of
                        a developers main goal in git-flow which is pumping
                        out easily manageable feature branches at blinding
                        speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The git process itself should hardly be a hurdle.  This
                        is a tool for collaboration that exists to help us
                        as developers maintain our work and work on teams.  I
                        don't think that the git commands that need to be run
                        to publish a release branch should take more than
                        a few seconds -- optimistically.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Initializing your repo on Github</h2>
                    <p>
                        This step is normally done for developers working on
                        business projects already.  However, there are times
                        where developers may want to create their own projects
                        for business or personal reasons.  First, create the
                        repository on Github itself and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys"
                        >set up your ssh keys</a>.
                        Then...
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/8346126.js?file=git1.sh"></script>
                    <p>
                        If your repository is being maintained by you, you
                        should also set up a <code>develop</code> branch
                        on Github and ideally make it the default branch
                        in the repository settings.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Branching out</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now that you have a repository,
                        the first concept to grasp when developing feature
                        branches is that you always want to cut from
                        <code>develop</code> -- and an up-to-date
                        <code>develop</code> at that.  This means that
                        the first step before even creating a feature
                        branch should be pulling develop.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/8346126.js?file=git2.sh"></script>
                    <p>
                        Ideally you would do this <em>every time</em> before
                        creating a new feature branch.  <strong>However</strong>,
                        your <code>develop</code> branch should <em>never</em>
                        contain changes that origin's develop does not have.
                        Make sure that you stash or otherwise remove outstanding
                        changes before you pull.  <code>git status</code>
                        should never report that your develop is any number
                        of commits ahead of origin's develop.  It can be
                        behind, of course -- that's why you pull.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course if you follow this development model properly,
                        no changes should ever sneak into your <code>develop</code>
                        at all.  They should only come from <code>git pull</code>
                        from origin's develop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once your develop is ready to go, you can create
                        your feature branch.  Features will probably be tied
                        to some user story or bug tracking number in a big
                        company that uses a tool like Jira.  For your own
                        projects, you can handle this however you want.  Just
                        make sure that you follow your organization's own
                        standards for feature branch naming.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/8346126.js?file=git3.sh"></script>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Warning:</strong> you should do whatever you
                        can to make sure that you are cutting a branch directly
                        from develop.  Use <code>git status</code>,
                        <code>git branch</code> (with no arguments), or others
                        to confirm that you are on the <strong>develop</strong>
                        branch.  You should only cut branches from non-develop
                        branches in advanced cases when you really know what
                        you're doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're using <a href="http://www.zsh.org/"><code>zsh</code></a>,
                        you can use <code>git_prompt_info</code> as part of your
                        prompt and it should display the current branch you are
                        on at each prompt.  A simple <kbd>Enter</kbd> or
                        <kbd>Ctrl+c</kbd> will update the prompt to confirm for you.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The art of commit messages</h2>
                    <p>
                        Get some work done on your branch and go crazy with
                        commits.  Writing commit messages is important and
                        also difficult to do properly.  Make sure that you
                        follow your organization's standards which probably
                        include prefacing all messages with the tracking
                        number for the feature you're working on
                        -- if it's available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my opinion, a good commit message starts with a very
                        succinct line summarizing the changes.  This line should
                        be at most 50 characters.  In fact, if you use
                        <code>git commit</code> <em>without</em> the
                        <code>-m</code> option (yes, this is possible), your
                        editor will open.  Vim's syntax highlighting for
                        the git commit message will highlight the first 50
                        characters on the first line, so you can even tell
                        when you've gone over.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have more to say than just 50 characters,
                        enter two newlines and go nuts saying whatever it
                        is you need/want to say.  I would still keep
                        the line length limit, but I suggest using
                        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown"
                        >Github flavored Markdown</a> for the bulk of
                        the message since most of your commit messages
                        will probably be viewed on Github and this will
                        be easier for others to read.  Markdown also has
                        the advantage of being semantic when viewed even
                        before it's parsed into markup and rendered.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/8346126.js?file=git4.sh"></script>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/8346126.js?file=git5.sh"></script>
                    <p>
                        Going over the 50 character limit is bad enough, but
                        even worse is the fact that <strong>the newline after
                        the introductory line was left out</strong>.  This
                        extra newline is actually important and it affects how
                        the <code>oneline</code> format of the log message
                        is displayed.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/ajcrites/8346126.js?file=git6.sh"></script>
                    <p>
                        If the extra newline after the first line is omitted,
                        git will simply treat the single newline as a space
                        when displaying logs in the handy <code>oneline</code>
                        format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifying the tracking number in the commit message
                        can be advantageous for some software.  For example,
                        it may move the item from "In Progress" to
                        "Development Completed" when your code is merged
                        automatically.  It's also helpful for when you
                        have to look at history.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Publishing your changes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now that you have awesome commit messages and feature
                        code ready to go, you want to deploy these to
                        Github for others to use.  <em>But wait!</em> Your
                        organization has decided that it prefers rebasing
                        changes onto the development branch rather than
                        merging them <em>into</em> the branch.  Rebasing
                        can simplify things for maintainers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without getting into a lot of details about what
                        rebasing is and how it works right now, it's
                        important to know this cardinal rule:
                        <strong>Do not <code>rebase</code> the same
                        branch twice!</strong>.  More accurately,
                        you should not rebase a <em>pushed</em> branch.
                        Even more accurately, you should not rebase
                        a pushed branch that has been pulled and is
                        still being actively worked on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the time, you probably won't need to
                        rebase a feature branch again.  It does depend, though.
                        If your changes get sent back to you, then
                        you won't have much of a choice if you have to
                        make a lot of changes before your feature will
                        be accepted for a merge.  If a reviewer refuses
                        to merge a branch that you've already rebased,
                        make sure you discuss how to handle the situation
                        unless you already have a strong understanding
                        of what really goes on with rebasing and how
                        best to add new changes to this branch to complete
                        the feature in a way that the merge will
                        be accepted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At any rate, other than moving the feature around
                        in your tracking software, you can complete
                        the feature and create a pull-request with
                        a handy script.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This assumes that...
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            you have the handy <a href="http://hub.github.com/"
                            ><code>hub</code></a> command installed -- a
                            command-line interface for Github 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>git</code> aliased to <code>hub</code>

                    <p>
                        In case you can't follow it, this script rebases your
                        current branch (hopefully a feature branch -- you
                        may want to double-check) on top of <code>develop</code>,
                        pushes your changes to Github, makes a pull request
                        to merge your feature branch with Github's <code>develop</code>
                        (and prints out a link to it for you) and checks out
                        <code>develop</code> so you can start on a new feature
                        branch again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can of course do all of these steps manually.
                        You can create the pull request on Github itself.
                        The <code>ProjectOwner</code> part obviously needs
                        to be changed to the owner of the repo.  If you have
                        forked the repo and are using your forked
                        copy as <code>origin</code>, you would be the owner
                        for the <code>-h</code> option.
                        Make sure you type an awesome pull-request message
                        in the same vein as a commit message.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once your awesome changes have been accepted and merged,
                        you should pull from <code>develop</code> again.
                        At this point, you can use <code>git branch -d
                        feature-branch</code> to delete the feature branch
                        since you don't need it anymore.  If you want to delete
                        it before it's been merged, us <code>-D</code>.  Just
                        make sure that you've pushed all your changes first!
                    </p>
                    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        As simple as I've tried to make this, it's still a lot
                        to take in.  Here are the simplified steps for
                        publishing a release branch with a git-flow rebase
                        model once you already have a working copy of
                        the repo and all you're all set for Github.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Make sure your <code>develop</code> branch is
                            up-to-date.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cut a feature branch from <code>develop</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make lots of changes.  Write nice commit messages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make sure <code>develop</code> is up-to-date...
                            again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rebase your feature branch onto develop.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Push your rebased feature branch to origin.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create a pull request to merge your feature
                            branch into develop.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If you happen to take part in the maintenance of
                        the repo, there may be some work for you now.
                        Luckily, it's pretty simple:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Review the proposed code changes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reject the changes with appropriate comments
                            if they're no good
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Confirm the merge if it's good.  Everyone should
                            be ready to pull from <code>develop</code>
                            again before starting a new feature branch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Delete the branch, if you're into that sort of thing.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If <code>develop</code> is not up-to-date locally,
                        you may wind up with a lot of unfortunate merge
                        conflicts.  It makes sense to work with only one
                        feature branch at a time.  This is not always possible,
                        though.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My article makes a lot of assumptions about names.
                        There is nothing special about the names
                        <code>develop</code>, <code>origin</code>,
                        or even <code>master</code>.  Make sure that you know
                        the taxonomy/terminology of your repositories
                        for whatever organization you are working for.
                        If one does not exist, work to create the standard.
