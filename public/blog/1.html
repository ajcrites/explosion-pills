                    <h1>Running a .NET Web App on a Virtual Machine on Linux Installed on a Macbook to Debug With an Android Emulator</h1>
                    <p>
                        It's really difficult for me not to make an inception joke about this whole process, but I've never actually
                        seen that movie.  Many thanks to Andrew K. for his help setting this deal up.  Without him, I never would have
                        been able to debug this project.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Acquiring a Macbook and installing Linux</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a pretty obvious first step.  Let's assume that you already have a Macbook.  Actually that part is not
                        particularly important.  Any computer will do.  <a href="http://www.alexvictorchan.com/2013/05/01/installing-ubuntu-13-04-on-13-macbook-pro-retina-102/"
                        >This tutorial on installing Ubuntu on a Macbook</a> was really helpful.  I don't have a 13" retina, so presumably
                        this tutorial will work with others in the Macbook family as well.  I've also had a great experience with <code><a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/">rEFInd</a></code>,
                        which the article links to (or should I say "to which the article links").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ubuntu is certainly not a requirement here.  Any Linux distribution with a GUI should be able to run VirtualBox
                        and be able to support port forwarding.  I also tried installing Arch Linux to boot from <code>rEFInd</code>, but
                        I ran into a lot of trouble and somehow corrupted my Ubuntu partition in the process.  I'll try again at some
                        point, but the Macbook is my work computer and has to be available to me for development at any time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Virtual Machine Software</h2>
                    <p>
                        A lot of people seem to love VMWare, but I personally prefer <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads">VirtualBox</a>.
                        You can use <code>dpkg</code> to install the <code>.deb</code> yourself if you desire, but VirtualBox is also available as
                        an aptitude package and you can install it from the command line too: <code>sudo apt-get install virtualbox</code>.  The command
                        <code>virtualbox</code> will start up the GUI, but the helpful <code>vboxmanage</code> command line tool is also available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>This guide will use VirtualBox</strong> as the Virtual Machine software.  If you want to use something else, you are
                        on your own.  The concepts should be the same, though.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Installing Windows</h2>
                    <p>
                        You will need a Windows boot CD, USB, or ISO.  I can't give one to you, but hopefully you already have one.  Once you do, start
                        <code>virtualbox</code> and choose New.  Pick an appropriate name for the VM (I just used "Windows") and select the version
                        that will be installed.  If you have an ISO it's probably in the name.  It may also be written on the CD.  You can just ask
                        whoever provided it to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point, unless you know what you're doing more than I do, just stick with the defaults.  Choose to create a new virtual
                        disk, and choose VDI as the hard drive type.  You can choose either "Dynamically allocated" or "Fixed size" though.  Supposedly
                        the latter is faster, but you will be able to grow and shrink the partition size of the former as needed.  Choose the appropriate
                        folder and ROM size.  I wouldn't go less than 25G for the partition size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now the VM will appear in VirtualBox's list of VMs.  Installing from an ISO is the simplest, so hopefully you have one available.
                        Boot the new VM (double-click it or select "Start" from the toolbar) and you will be asked for the location of the boot disk.
                        Select the ISO and wait for several hours while Windows is installed.  Once that is complete you can theoretically discard the ISO
                        as it probably takes up a lot of space, but beware as you won't be able to install the OS afresh again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> that if you do remove the ISO file, VirtualBox will complain when you boot.  It will still boot from the OS
                        installed on the virtual hard disk.  If you want to stop it from complaining, while the VM is powered off select "Settings -> Storage,
                        and remove the ISO.  You can also simply choose to ignore the warning as it is harmless in this case.
                    </p>
                    <aside>
                        <h1>Increasing an existing VM's size</h1>
                        <p>
                            <strong>NOTE:</strong> that this is not a necessary step.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you already have a virtual machine partition, you may want to increase the ROM size.  You can't do this with a fixed partition,
                            but you can with a standard partition.  One solution is to clone the fixed partition and then increase that one's size.  If it's
                            Windows, you have to boot it and then use "Disk Manager," right click "C:" and select "Extend Volume."  Your guess is as good as
                            mine as to where "Disk Manager" actually is so I just opened up "My Computer" and use "Search" to find it.  Certainly it's in different
                            spots in different versions (Windows 7, Windows 8).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The actual commands you would use would be
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
        $ cd ~/VirtualBox\ VMs # what's with the space?
        $ cd $DESIRED_VM_DIR
        $ vboxmanage clonehd --variant Standard $VBOX_NAME.vdi $NEW_NAME.vdi
        $ vboxmanage modifyhd $NEW_NAME.vdi --resize 51200 # 50G, it's in MB
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            Note that only the <code>modifyhd</code> command is necessary if the disk is already Standard and not Fixed.
                            <code>vboxmanage</code> will complain if you try to resize a fixed partition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this point you can use the VirtualBox GUI to create a new VM from the cloned <code>.vdi</code> file.
                            There is probably a way to do this via <code>vboxmanage</code> as well, but I didn't try.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Running the .NET project form Visual Studio</h2>
                    <p>
                        I can't help very much with actually <em>setting up</em> the web application project
                        since the one I worked with was already done.  There were a couple important points, though.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You must run the project with the C# server as opposed to the IIS server.
                            The IIS firewall is nuts.  This is a setting in the <code>Properties</code>
                            pseudo-file.  If you actually are going to use IIS, don't forget to change it back!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In case "Start" doesn't work, you can try right-clicking the project and
                            selecting "View in Browser."  If you can actually view it in the browser,
                            it's ready for port forwarding.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Port Forwarding from Windows</h2>
                    <p>
                        While Windows may have a way to do this natively, it's much easier to use
                        <a href="http://download.cnet.com/SPI-Port-Forward/3000-2651_4-10764348.html"
                        >SPI Port Forward</a>.  Yes, although the site looks like a scam site it's a
                        legit download.  Plus it will just be on your virtual machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Run SPI Port Forward and set the "Local Port" and "Remote Port" to whatever port
                        your web app is running on (in my case 5653).  This is the same as whatever port
                        your browser in Windows is using to access the app.
                        <strong>Also set "Remote host" to <code>localhost</code></strong>.  The port
                        forwarding mysteriously does not work if you don't do this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next you have to change the VM settings for the host to listen on the appropriate port.
                        In Virtualbox, Right-click the VM and click "Settings" (or select it and click the Settings
                        button in the toolbar).  Select "Network," and then "Port Forwarding."  For "Host Port"
                        select whatever port you want (remember that ports below 1024 are privileged) and for
                        "Guest Port" select the port Windows is using to run the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now you should be able to access the app on your host machine via <code>localhost:&lt;HOST-PORT></code>.
                        In case this does not work, try deactivating and activating SPI Port Forward again.  The Log
                        for SPI Port Forward should be reporting connections when they come.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> If you accidentally close SPI Port Forward, I'm actually not sure what
                        to do.  Restarting the Windows machine will put you back in the shape you need, though.  You also
                        need to deactivate and activate each time you redeploy the app.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Accessing your web app in an Android emulator</h2>
                    <p>
                        You can't use <code>localhost</code> on Android as that is the loopback address for the Android
                        machine and it's not running the app.  Port forwarding may be possible, but it's much simpler
                        to just use your host machine's IP address.  Run <code>ifconfig</code> on the host machine
                        and see the <code>inet addr</code> section (probably under <code>eth1</code>).  You should
                        be able to access your app on Android or other devices on the network via <code>HOST-IP:4000</code>.
